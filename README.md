# Dimension-S
Sidechain DImension-S for sharing and energy


# Project Brief  

Conventional enterprises are facing pressures to be more innovative with their business models. They need to learn how to gain competitive advantages from emerging technologies and opportunities. For example, the sharing and collaborative economic model can be a good business solution for most enterprises.

Other than this, more data is generated by mobile devices than ever before, meaning human behaviors and mobile usages are becoming closer than ever. But the data ownership and rights have never been attributed, evaluated, quantified and used. The user as the data producer has never benefitted from ownership of the data. The value of the data is always fragmented and never really forms an effective interworking mechanism.

Dimension-S will map and segment real-world assets into digital assets by providing a trading system to help enterprises promote data sharing and trading, improving business profitability and economic efficiency.
